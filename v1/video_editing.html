<h1>Video Editing Work Samples</h1>
<p>TECHNICAL TOOLS: Adobe Premiere | Final Cut Pro</p>

<h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
<p class="description">Motion graphic samples made for 45R's online/offline events. 
    These contents were used on the website, instagram posts and weekly newsletters. 
    I laid the elements on the floor and shot the graphics with iPhoneX in a small room. 
    I edited the graphics for each frame with photoshop and created the motion video with Final Cut Pro.
